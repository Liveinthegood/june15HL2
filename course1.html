It's easy to imagine all of the things that can go wrong and talk ourselves out of just about anything.</h1>

    <h1 class="bodytext"><span class="pro">The Native American Guide to Handling Toxic People - </span><br>This course examines over thirty different kinds of people and situations that steal our time and energy. There are ways to handle this without getting sucked into the drama and desires of others. When we examine these people using the Wheel of Life, we can find the best ways to counteract their behavior and save our energy and time. There are thirty-five different types of people and situations discussed in this course.</h1>

    <img class="successville2 " src="images/course 2 number 1.png" alt="course 2 picture 1 picture">

    <hr>


    
    <h1 class="bodytext">There are four kinds of the following toxic people discussed in this course: the sly and deviant, our rulers, persecutors, those who infuriate us, the violent bullies, ones who shame us, pesky and annoying people, and the most difficult of all, our inner bullies. The voices in our heads sometimes treat us worse than anyone else. The voices that feed on our fears, our fear feeders, hold us back from living our life to our fullest potential. They survive on our fears and when we learn how to silence them, we find ourselves with much less stress and anger. </h1>

    <hr>

    
    <h1 class="bodytext">This course helps us to manage situations beyond our control that cause us stress, like a pandemic, environmental disasters beyond our control, and the age-old problems of not enough time or space. This information comes from the centuries-old indigenous American people of North and Central America. It has been passed on through generations due to its accuracy and eternal relevance. Handling toxic people and situations isnâ€™t about being stronger, itâ€™s about being smarter.</h1>

  <h1 class="bodytext"><span class="pro">Ayahuasca and other Native American Teaching Plants - </span><br>People have used many types of hallucinogenic, or teaching plants, for thousands of years. There has recently been a lot of interest in such plants. Many people are stressed, depressed, anxious, lost, and separated from the Creator. They're looking for a solution to their problems, a way to tap into a vast resource of knowledge and love they know is waiting for them. Teaching plants can hold the answer for some. I was taught the traditional ways to respectfully use such plants by the elders of my tribe.</h1> 

  <hr>


  <img class="successville2 " src="images/plant pic 3.png" alt="plant 3 picture">

  <hr>


  <h1 class="bodytext"><span class="pro"></span>In this course, I share the 13 steps one may experience with a strong teaching plant. You may be surprised to find that the first few steps are often done on your own.</h1>
  
  <hr>

  
  <h1 class="bodytext">We'll also talk about the 11 steps on the Red Human Road, a path that can be traveled without the help of teaching plants, and how the first few steps on both paths are similar. You'll learn about the assemblage point and why some people are depressed and suicidal.</h1> 

  <hr>

  <img class="successville2 " src="images/plant pic 1.png" alt="plant 1 picture">

<hr>
  
  <h1 class="bodytext">When my culture looks at such conditions, they are not simply a diagnosis, they show a clear path out of such despair. Teaching plants can offer one such path. These steps are not done at once. Often it will take a lifetime to traverse them all, or even several lifetimes.</h1> 

  <hr>

  
  <h1 class="bodytext">Every step awakens a deeper part of us and we may find ourselves at peace and more enlightened if we understand the steps, approach them with no fear, and are open to the experience. Plants such as ayahuasca, peyote, and magic mushrooms should always be used cautiously and with respect. It's wise to be prepared and that's why I've offered this course. However, a guide is still recommended when using these plants.</h1> 

  <hr>

  <img class="successville2 " src="images/plant pic 2.png" alt="plant 2 picture">


  
  <h1 class="bodytext">Many tourists who travel to other countries in search of an ayahuasca experience may find tribal elders are reluctant to accompany them on their experience. This is because so many people have used the opportunity simply to get high. This can be very disheartening for those of us who see teaching plants as sacred gifts. </h1>

  <h1 class="bodytext"><span class="pro">The Ancient Technology of Working With Brain Wave Manipulation - </span><br>There are many ancient technologies we have yet to re-discover. There have been stories of miracles throughout history. We even have evidence in the form of the Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, Gobekli Tepe, Machu, Picchu, and other examples of construction we aren't able to replicate today. One of the things I have always been fascinated with is the power of the mind. Many cultures around the world have described people with great abilities. Most of these cultures and their secrets are long buried. Only the ones that survived in isolation for centuries have been able to keep these traditions alive. </h1>

  <hr>

  <img class="successville2 " src="images/plant pic 3.png" alt="plant 3 picture">

  <hr>
  
  <h1 class="bodytext">One of these nations is the Hawaiians. Max Freedom Long discovered the power of huna in the early 1900s and wrote several books about what he had learned. The Hawaiians were able to cure diseases and see the future and change it all with the help of these techniques. Max experienced this personally when he went to a kahuna for help. I studied with a traditional Hawaiian kahuna on the Big Island of Hawaii in the 1980s. </h1>

  <hr>

  
  <h1 class="bodytext">This course explains how modern science is beginning to understand how the Hawaiians manipulated their brain waves and used brain wave awareness to perform what appeared to be miracles. The similarities between the Indigenous peoples of North America and Hawaii are not coincidental. Our legends speak of the brotherhood between our people and our legends and cultural practices reflect this as well.</h1> 

  <hr>

  
  <h1 class="bodytext">This course shares some of these cultural similarities that relate to brain wave manipulation. You'll learn about the inner personas, the fear feeders, how brain waves correspond to our different stages of development as we grow, and how we can work with this knowledge to improve our life. You'll see how brain wave awareness can improve your memory and your ability to learn. You'll be able to monitor your brain waves without expensive medical equipment and learn how to work with this brain wave awareness to live your life to your fullest potential.  </h1>

    <H1 class="honor2">Live the life you planned before you were born without shame.</h1> 

    <h1 class="bodytext"> Native American tradition says we planned our life before we were born. This is our Sacred Dream or our Childrenâ€™s Fire. Denying this dream goes against The Creator. Armed with the tools in this course, youâ€™ll be able to confidently walk your path undeterred by toxic people and make yourself a priority.</h1>

    <img class="successville2" src="images/S3_danceofcoyotes.jpg" alt="dance of coyotes picture">



    
    <h1 class="bodytext">The Dance of the Coyotes shows us the opposite. The Story of Your Life shows you exactly how you are in control. The Wheel of Attitudes and Approaches introduces us to solutions we may never have considered. The Wheel of Life is the key to all medicine wheels and shows us exactly what each direction stands for to gain a deeper understanding. Youâ€™ll learn to recognize people who are highly influenced by the opinions of others and why this can be problematic.</h1>

    <hr>

    
    <h1 class="bodytext">Many of us donâ€™t even realize how others have impacted our behavior until we see on the medicine wheel. Living our life for others can be disguised as independence. Having control over our inner dialog is the first step and youâ€™ll learn how to recognize words that simply feed on your fears and silence them. When we know what we truly want out of life, our Sacred Dream, our spirit is re-energized and our life has purpose.</h1>
